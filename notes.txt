7 little words solver - Cody's personal notes


a. enter word length
b. enter tiles
c. give most likely solution

1. create array of length seven (7 little words, duh)
2. fill in 1 with a
3. create array of length 20 (number of tiles)
4. fill 3 with 'tile' objects created from b

5. load dictionary
	--sort into alphabetical groups of same length words
6. eliminate all words with no matching length
7. eliminate all words not starting with letter combinations that match tiles
8. eliminate all words not ending with letter combinations that match tiles
9. create algorithm to process different tile length combinations for each word length
	--tiles can only be of length 2, 3, or 4
	--DANGER: if the word length is 4, it can be 2+2 or 4. how do i distinguish that?
	ex: words of length 4 can only contain tiles of length 2 + 2
		words of length 5 can only contain tiles of length 2 + 3
		6: 2 + 2 + 2 , 3 + 3, 4 + 2
		7: 7 - 2 = 5, 7 - 3 = 4, 7 - 4 = 3
		8: 8 - 2 = 6, 8 - 3 = 5, 8 - 4 = 4

10. create structure of all possible words, compare vs dictionary. 
	--eliminate combos with no vowels (subroutine checkVowels?)
	
	


PROS:
	variable - can adjust if you have some words solved and tiles used
			 - you can search for just one word length if you don't want to spoil the whole puzzle

CONS:
	limited - can only search for words in the dictionary (no pronouns - the game sometimes has pronouns)
	repetative - words can include repeat tiles. a future version will include a narrowing function - displays "predicted" solutions based on
